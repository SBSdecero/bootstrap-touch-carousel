# Bootstrap TouchCarousel

Use twitter bootstrap & hammer.js to create fully working touch-based image carousel.

## Quick start

1. [Download zip.](https://github.com/ixisio/bootstrap-touch-carousel/archive/master.zip)
2. Clone the repo: git clone git://github.com/ixisio/bootstrap-touch-carousel.git.
3. As a bootstrap git submodule.

## How it works

This jQuery Plugin is designed to add touch-support to your existing bootstrap carousel. The only thing you have to do, is to load these to files:

```
/dist/js/bootstrap-touch-carousel.js
/dist/css/bootstrap-touch-carousel.css

```

## Compiling CSS and JavaScript

> Bootstrap uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) with convenient methods for working with the framework. It's how we compile our code, run tests, and more. To use it, install the required dependencies as directed and then run some Grunt commands.

[See twbs docs](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/README.md)

## Future Tasks

* Endless Loops (cycle)
* Hammer.js custom build (use only whats required)
* MSPointer: Support pointer and gesture events. Tests needed!
* Better Documentation
* Unit Tests (qunit)
* Without-Hammerjs Version
